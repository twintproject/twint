>No authentication. No API. No limits.

Twint is an advanced Twitter scraping tool written in Python that allows for scraping Tweets from Twitter profiles **without** using Twitter's API.

Twint utilizes Twitter's search operators to let you scrape Tweets from specific users, scrape Tweets relating to certain topics, hashtags & trends, or sort out *sensitive* information from Tweets like e-mail and phone numbers. I find this very useful, and you can get really creative with it too.

Twint also makes special queries to Twitter allowing you to also scrape a Twitter user's followers, Tweets a user has liked, and who they follow **without** any authentication, API, Selenium, or browser emulation.

## tl;dr Benefits
Some of the benefits of using Twint vs Twitter API:
- Can fetch almost __all__ Tweets (Twitter API limits to last 3200 Tweets only);
- Fast initial setup;
- Can be used anonymously and without Twitter sign up;
- **No rate limitations**.

## Limits imposed by Twitter
Twitter limits scrolls while browsing the user timeline. This means that with `.Profile` or with `.Favorites` you will be able to get ~3200 tweets.

## Module Example

Twint can now be used as a module and supports custom formatting. **More details are located in the [wiki](https://github.com/twintproject/twint/wiki/Module)**

```python
import twint

# Configure
c = twint.Config()
c.Username = "realDonaldTrump"
c.Search = "great"

# Run
twint.run.Search(c)
```
> Output

`955511208597184512 2018-01-22 18:43:19 GMT <now> pineapples are the best fruit`

```python
import twint

c = twint.Config()

c.Username = "noneprivacy"
c.Custom["tweet"] = ["id"]
c.Custom["user"] = ["bio"]
c.Limit = 10
c.Store_csv = True
c.Output = "none"

twint.run.Search(c)
```

## Storing Options
- Write to file;
- CSV;
- JSON;
- SQLite;
- Elasticsearch.

## FAQ
> I tried scraping tweets from a user, I know that they exist but I'm not getting them

Twitter can shadow-ban accounts, which means that their tweets will not be available via search. To solve this, pass `--profile-full` if you are using Twint via CLI or, if are using Twint as module, add `config.Profile_full = True`. Please note that this process will be quite slow.
## More Examples

#### Followers/Following

> To get only follower usernames/following usernames

`twint -u username --followers`

`twint -u username --following`

> To get user info of followers/following users

`twint -u username --followers --user-full`

`twint -u username --following --user-full`

#### userlist

> To get only user info of user

`twint -u username --user-full`

> To get user info of users from a userlist

`twint --userlist inputlist --user-full`


#### tweet translation (experimental)

> To get 100 english tweets and translate them to italian

`twint -u noneprivacy --csv --output none.csv --lang en --translate --translate-dest it --limit 100`

or

```python
import twint

c = twint.Config()
c.Username = "noneprivacy"
c.Limit = 100
c.Store_csv = True
c.Output = "none.csv"
c.Lang = "en"
c.Translate = True
